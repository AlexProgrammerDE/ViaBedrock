# ViaBedrock
ViaVersion addon to add support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers.

ViaBedrock aims to be as compatible and accurate as possible with the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition protocol.

## Usage
**ViaBedrock is in very early stages of development and NOT intended for regular use yet.**

If you want to try it out anyway you can download the latest dev build
[here](https://build.lenni0451.net/job/ViaBedrock) (Make sure to download the ViaProxy-ViaBedrockPlugin jar file).

To use the ViaProxy implementation of ViaBedrock you have to download [ViaProxy](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ViaProxy) first and put the ViaProxy-ViaBedrockPlugin jar file into the plugins folder of ViaProxy.

**Do not report any bugs yet. There are still a lot of things which are not implemented yet.**
